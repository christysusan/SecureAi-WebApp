## 1. Introduction to Web Development

Web development is the process of building websites and web applications that run in a browser. It involves using programming languages, frameworks, and tools to create interactive, user-friendly experiences. Modern web apps are often built using JavaScript and frameworks like React, which allow for dynamic, fast, and scalable interfaces.

---

## 2. What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now one of the most popular tools for creating web apps. React lets you break your UI into reusable components, making your code easier to manage and update. It uses a virtual DOM for fast updates and provides a declarative way to describe how your UI should look.

**Key Concepts:**
- Components: Reusable building blocks for your UI.
- Props: Data passed to components.
- State: Data managed within a component.
- Hooks: Functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

---

## 3. What is JavaScript and TypeScript?

**JavaScript** is the main programming language of the web. It runs in the browser and allows you to create interactive websites.

**TypeScript** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. This means you can catch errors before running your code, making it safer and easier to maintain. TypeScript files use the `.ts` or `.tsx` extension.

---

## 4. What is Next.js?

Next.js is a framework built on top of React. It adds features like server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and file-based routing. This makes it easier to build fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web apps.

**Key Features:**
- File-based routing: Create pages by adding files to the `app/` directory.
- API routes: Build backend endpoints in the same project.
- Server-side rendering: Render pages on the server for better performance and SEO.

---

## 5. What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing custom CSS, you use pre-defined classes to style your HTML. This makes it fast to build and easy to maintain consistent designs.

**Example:**
```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">Click Me</button>
```

---

## 6. What is Zustand?

Zustand is a small, fast state management library for React. It lets you manage global state (like user settings or scan results) outside of your components, making your app easier to scale.

---

## 7. What is Radix UI?

Radix UI is a library of low-level, accessible UI components for React. It provides building blocks like dialogs, menus, and tooltips that you can style as you like.

---

## 8. What is Framer Motion?

Framer Motion is a library for animations in React. It lets you add smooth transitions and interactive effects to your UI.

---

## 9. What is an API?

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software systems to communicate. In web development, APIs are often HTTP endpoints that accept requests and return data. For example, when you check if a password is breached, your app sends a request to the HIBP API and gets a response.

**Key Concepts:**
- Endpoint: A URL where you can send requests (e.g., `/api/pwned`).
- Request: The data you send (often using GET or POST methods).
- Response: The data you get back (often in JSON format).

---

## 10. What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is an AI system trained on massive amounts of text data. LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini can understand and generate human-like text. In SecureAI-Code, LLMs are used to analyze code, find vulnerabilities, and suggest fixes.

**How LLMs are used here:**
- You send code to the LLM via an API.
- The LLM analyzes the code and returns a vulnerability report.
- The report is mapped to security standards (like CWE) and shown in the UI.

---

## 11. What is Web Hosting?

Web hosting is a service that puts your website on the internet. A hosting provider stores your files and runs your code on a server, so users can access your site from anywhere.

---

## 12. What is Vercel?

Vercel is a modern hosting platform for web apps. It automatically builds and deploys your site when you push code to GitHub. Vercel provides a live URL, handles scaling, SSL, and performance optimizations for you.

---

## 13. Project Structure Overview

---

## 14. How the SecureAI-Code Web App Works
