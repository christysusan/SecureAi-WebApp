## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### News Feed Architecture

**Service Layer** (`lib/news.ts`)
- Fetches from 3 RSS feeds via rss2json.com API
- Normalizes heterogeneous feed data
- Deduplicates by URL
- Groups items by publication date
- Returns fallback content on failure
- Caches responses with 30-minute revalidation

**API Layer** (`app/api/news/route.ts`)
- Edge runtime for optimal performance
- Calls `fetchSecurityNews(24)` to get latest items
- Returns JSON response with status + items array

**UI Layer** (`app/news/page.tsx`)
- Client component with state management
- Auto-refresh interval (30 minutes)
- Featured articles section (top 3)
- Chronologically grouped feed display
- Skeleton loading states
- Error handling with graceful fallback

### Type System Resolution

**Problem**: React 19 runtime with React 18 type definitions  
**Solution**: Upgraded both `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to v19  
**Result**: All JSX component type errors resolved, clean compilation

### Games Deprecation Strategy

**Approach**: Graceful degradation instead of hard deletion
- Pages return Next.js `notFound()` → proper 404 handling
- API endpoints return HTTP 410 Gone with descriptive message
- Components remain in `/components/games/*` for potential reuse
- State/types cleaned from active codebase

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Visit `/news` and verify feed loads
- [ ] Test auto-refresh after 30 minutes
- [ ] Verify `/games` returns 404

### API Testing
```bash
# Test news endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/news

# Test deprecated games endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/games/snake/score
# Expected: {"error":"GAMES_RETIRED","message":"..."}
```

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Keep Game Components?
Game components remain in `/components/games/*` for potential future educational features or derivative projects. They're isolated and won't affect the build size significantly.

### Why 410 Gone for Game APIs?
HTTP 410 explicitly signals "permanently removed" vs 404 "never existed," helping clients understand the intentional deprecation.

### Why RSS2JSON Proxy?
Direct RSS parsing in browser/edge runtime is complex. The rss2json.com service provides reliable normalization across different feed formats.

### Why 30-Minute Refresh?
Balances freshness with API rate limits and user experience. Security news doesn't change every second, but staying current is valuable.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Type Versioning Matters**: React 18 types + React 19 runtime = pervasive JSX errors
2. **Graceful Deprecation**: Stub pages with `notFound()` > hard deletion
3. **State Cleanup**: Remove unused Zustand slices to avoid stale references
4. **Feed Aggregation**: External RSS services simplify multi-source ingestion
5. **Branding Consistency**: Update storage keys, temp paths, UA strings—not just UI text
